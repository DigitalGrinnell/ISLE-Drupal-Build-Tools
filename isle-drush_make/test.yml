# ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools/isle-drush_make/islandora.drush.make.yml
#
# This is the Drush "makefile" for building STOCK Islandora parts (modules and libraries) of the
# Apache container in an ISLE stack.
#
# Important!  Since each project has a different URL it is imperative that each has a download: url:value option.
#   Therefore, each project here should be declared with the following syntax:
#
#   projects:
#     project-name:
#       download:
#         url: https://path-to-project-repo
#
# This is a YAML file... indentation is critical, so don't screw it up!
#
