# ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools/isle-drush_make/drupal.drush.make.yml
#
# This is the Drush "makefile" for building a STOCK Drupal site and contributed parts (modules and libraries) of the
# Apache container in an ISLE stack.
#
# Important!  Since the projects here all use the default options, and reqiure no options of their own, it
#   is acceptable to list them with the following syntax:
#
#   projects:
#     - project-name
#     - project-name
#
#   However, libraries require options that do NOT match the defaults, so they must be declared like:
#
#   libraries:
#     library-project-name:
#       download:
#         url: https://path-to-project-repo
#         type: git (or 'get' in the case of non-git repopositories)
#         directory_name: directory-name-for-the-local-instance
#       type: library
#
# This is a YAML file... indentation is critical, so don't screw it up!
#
# Projects are listed in ALPHABETICAL order.  Please maintain the order and use trailing comments as necessary.

core: 7.x   # Required
