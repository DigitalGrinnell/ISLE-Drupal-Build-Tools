# ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools/isle-drush_make/custom.d/custom.islandora.drush.make.yml
#
# This is the Drush "makefile" for building adding CUSTOM Islandora contributed parts (modules and libraries) to the
# Apache container in an ISLE stack.
#
# Important!  Since each project has a different URL it is imperative that each has a download: url:value option.
#   Therefore, each project here should be declared with the following syntax:
#
#   projects:
#     project-name:
#       download:
#         url: https://path-to-project-repo
#
# This is a YAML file... indentation is critical, so don't screw it up!
#
# Projects are listed in ALPHABETICAL order.  Please maintain the order and use trailing comments as necessary.
#

# Do NOT declare defaults: here!
# This makefile is included after the STOCK makefile, where defaults are properly declared.  Defaults here would only get in the way!
