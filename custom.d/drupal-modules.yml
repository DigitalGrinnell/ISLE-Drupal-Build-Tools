# ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools/isle-drush_make/custom.d/custom.drupal.drush.make.yml
#
# This is the Drush "makefile" for building adding CUSTOM Drupal contributed parts (modules and libraries) to the
# Apache container in an ISLE stack.
#
# Important!  Since the projects here all use the default options, and reqiure no options of their own, it
#   is acceptable to list them with the following syntax:
#
#   projects:
#     - project-name
#     - project-name
#
#   However, if options that do NOT match the defaults are required, the list elements should must be declared like:
#
#   projects:
#     project-name:
#       download:
#         url: https://path-to-project-repo
#         type: git (or 'get' in the case of non-git repopositories)
#       type: module (or theme, or library)
#
# This is a YAML file... indentation is critical, so don't screw it up!
#
# Projects are listed in ALPHABETICAL order.  Please maintain the order and use trailing comments as necessary.
#
core: 7.x   # Required
api: 2      # Required

# Do NOT declare defaults: here!
# This makefile is included after the STOCK makefile, where defaults are properly declared.  Defaults here would only get in the way!
