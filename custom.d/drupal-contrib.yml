# ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools/isle-drush_make/custom.d/drupal-contrib.yml
#
# This is the Drush "makefile" for building adding CUSTOM Drupal CONTRIB parts (modules and libraries) to the
# Apache container in an ISLE stack.
#
# Note: If you have a working version of ISLE consider opening a terminal into the Apache container, and run
#   the following to generate a YAML-formatted makefile (make.yml in the example command below) that can be
#   used to verify or modify this file:
#
#    docker exec -it isle-apache-{SHORT_NAME} bash
#    cd /var/www/html/sites/default
#    drush -u 1 make-generate > make.yml
#
# Important!  Since the projects here all use the default options, and reqiure no options of their own, it
#   is acceptable to list them with the following syntax:
#
#   projects:
#     - project-name
#     - project-name
#
#   However, if options that do NOT match the defaults are required, the list elements should be declared like:
#
#   projects:
#     project-name:
#       download:
#         url: https://path-to-project-repo
#         type: git (or 'get' in the case of non-git repopositories)
#       type: module (or theme, or library)
#
# NEVER mix one form with the other.  So, don't do this...
#
#   projects:
#     - project-name
#     next-project:
#
# This is a YAML file... indentation is critical, so don't screw it up!
#
# Projects are listed in ALPHABETICAL order.  Please maintain the order and use trailing comments as necessary.
