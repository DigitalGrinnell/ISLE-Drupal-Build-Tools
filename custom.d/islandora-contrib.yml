# ISLE-Drupal-Build-Tools/isle-drush_make/custom.d/islandora-contrib.yml
#
# This is the Drush "makefile" for building adding CUSTOM Islandora contributed parts (modules and libraries) to the
# Apache container in an ISLE stack.
#
# Note: If you have a working version of ISLE consider opening a terminal into the Apache container, and run
#   the following to generate a YAML-formatted makefile (make.yml in the example command below) that can be
#   used to verify or modify this file:
#
#    docker exec -it isle-apache-{SHORT_NAME} bash
#    cd /var/www/html/sites/default
#    drush -u 1 make-generate > make.yml
#
# Important!  Since each project has a different URL it is imperative that each has a download: url:value option.
#   Therefore, each project here should be declared with the following syntax:
#
#   projects:
#     project-name:
#       download:
#         url: https://path-to-project-repo
#
# This is a YAML file... indentation is critical, so don't screw it up!
#
# Projects are listed in ALPHABETICAL order.  Please maintain the order and use trailing comments as necessary.
